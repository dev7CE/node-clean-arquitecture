- Presentation: closest layer for user API consumption, examples of posible proyects would be: Express.js, Fastify... any other web framework.
- Domain: contains application rules, such as Use Cases, Adapters, Datasources, How Repositories. It is recommended that any code located in this layer has no external dependencies.
  + Entities: Piece of data which has strong similarity in comparation to Database objects, but are not linked each other. 
  + DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Carries data between processes. They dont have any business logic 
- Infrastructure: intermedial layer located between presentation and domain layers. This layer is responsible for implement Adapters, Datasources and Repositories from domain layer, it also uses Mappers.
