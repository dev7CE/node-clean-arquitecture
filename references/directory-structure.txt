- Presentation: closest layer for user API consumption, examples of posible proyects would be: Express.js, Fastify... any other web framework.
- Domain: contains application rules, such as Use Cases, Adapters, Datasources, How Repositories. It is recommended that any code located in this layer has no external dependencies.
  + Entities: Piece of data which has strong similarity in comparation to Database objects, but are not linked each other. 
  + DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Carries data between processes. They dont have any business logic 
  + Datasources: business rules for retrieve data. They're abstractions only.
  + Repositories: establish communication with Datasources. They're abstractions only.
- Infrastructure: intermedial layer located between presentation and domain layers. This layer is responsible for implement Adapters, Datasources and Repositories from domain layer, it also uses Mappers.
  + datasources: datasource implementation.
  + repositories: repositories implementation.
  + mappers: works as a bridge between layers.
- Data: contains files for databases, such as connection, models... among other resources. This folder may contain subfolders based on databases required.
  + mongodb: connection with Mongo DB instance.
